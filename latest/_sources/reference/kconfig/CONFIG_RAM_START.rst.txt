*Address of the RAM region assigned to the hypervisor*

Type: ``hex``

Help
====

A 64-bit integer indicating the base address to where the hypervisor
should be loaded to. If RELOC is disabled the bootloader is required to
load the hypervisor to this specific address. Otherwise the hypervisor
will not boot.With RELOC enabled the hypervisor is capable of relocating
its symbols to where it is placed at, and thus the bootloader may not
place the hypervisor at this specific address.


Defaults

- 0x6e000000 if \ :option:`PLATFORM_SBL <CONFIG_PLATFORM_SBL>`
- 0x00100000 if \ :option:`PLATFORM_UEFI <CONFIG_PLATFORM_UEFI>`
