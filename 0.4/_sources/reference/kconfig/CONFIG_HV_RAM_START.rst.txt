*Start physical address of the RAM region used by the hypervisor*

Type: ``hex``

Help
====

A 64-bit integer indicating the base physical address where the
hypervisor should be loaded. If RELOC is disabled, the bootloader
is required to load the hypervisor to this specific address.
Otherwise the hypervisor will not boot. With RELOC enabled the
hypervisor may relocate its symbols to where it is placed,
and thus the bootloader might not place the hypervisor at this
specific address.


Defaults
========

- 0x6e000000 if \ :option:`PLATFORM_SBL <CONFIG_PLATFORM_SBL>`
- 0x00100000 if \ :option:`PLATFORM_UEFI <CONFIG_PLATFORM_UEFI>`
