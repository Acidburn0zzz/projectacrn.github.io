====

By specifying SCENARIO name, ACRN will load corresponding VM configurations
to build the hypervisor. Currently ACRN provides four reference scenarios:

- industry: Typical scenario for industry usage with 8 VMs: one pre-launched SOS VM,
  one post-launched KATA VM, one post-launched RT VM for real-time control,
  and up to five post-launched Standard VMs;
- hybrid: Typical scenario for hybrid usage with 3 VMs: one pre-launched Safety VM,
  one pre-launched Service VM and one post-launched Standard VM;
- hybrid_rt: Typical scenario for hybrid real-time usage with 3 VMs: one
  pre-launched RTVM, one pre-launched Service VM and one post-launched Standard VM;
- logical_partition: Typical scenario that run two isolated pre-launched VMs

Other values are possible if a corresponding scenario has been created
under 'misc/vm_configs/scenarios/' in the source code.
